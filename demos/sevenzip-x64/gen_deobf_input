## Patched version

To patch the 7-Zip binary in order to reduce the number of KDF iterations, follow the following process:
1. Open the `7za` binary in BinaryNinja
2. Go to the instruction `0xb30c6 mov dword [esi+0x1c], 0x13`
3. Patch the instruction to `mov dword [esi+0x1c], 0x0` (i.e., change the constant to `0`) using the option `Patch > Edit current line` in the BinaryNinja context menu.
4. Save the file as `7za-patched`.
