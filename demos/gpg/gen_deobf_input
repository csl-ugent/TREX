# GnuPG (GPG)

The source code of GPG is available at https://gnupg.org/. The currently used version is 2.2.29 (LTS).

A pre-built executable is checked in into the repo, but you can rebuild GPG using the `build.sh` script in this directory. Note that this build is Dockerized, so you need to have `docker` installed.
